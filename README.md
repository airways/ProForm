## Installation
Installing ProForm is similar to installing any third-party Module into ExpressionEngine.

### Installation Steps
Follow these steps to install ProForm:

 0. This add-on REQUIRES ProLib to be in your third_party directory. Get it here:
       https://github.com/airways/ProLib

 1. Download the ZIP file from the location where you purchased it.

 2. Extract the ZIP file.

 3. Move directories.
 
 <b>For git checkout:</b>
 
   a. Check out or copy files from the repo directly to [doc_root]/system/expressionengine/third_party/proform
   
   b. Move or create a symlink from [doc_root]/system/expressionengine/third_party/proform/themes to [doc_root]/themes/third_party/proform
   
   c. Check out or copy files from the the ProLib repo directly to [doc_root]/system/expressionengine/third_party/prolib
   
   d. Move or create a symlink from [doc_root]/system/expressionengine/third_party/prolib/themes to [doc_root]/themes/third_party/prolib
 
   <b>For ZIP file build:</b>
   
   There are four folders within the extracted folder from the ZIP file. Copy each one to the matching location
   within your ExpressionEngine installation:
   
   [extracted_folder]/system/expressionengine/third_party/proform → [doc_root]/system/expressionengine/third_party/proform
        
   [extracted_folder]/system/expressionengine/third_party/prolib → [doc_root]/system/expressionengine/third_party/prolib
        
   [extracted_folder]/themes/third_party/proform → [doc_root]/themes/third_party/proform
        
   [extracted_folder]/themes/third_party/prolib → [doc_root]/themes/third_party/prolib
        
   
 4. Visit your control panel, usually located at:
        http://example.com/system/

 5. Click on Add-ons > Modules in the main menu.

 6. Within the list of Modules you will find an entry for ProForm, click on the Install link next to this entry.

 7. You will be taken to a Package Settings screen, listing entries for ProForm's components. Make sure that all
   components have Install selected.

 8. Click Submit to finish installation.

 9. After the module is installed, you can find a link to it's main page in the list at Add-ons > Modules.

10. On the main ProForm page, you may want to click the + Add link in the menu bar. This will add a main menu
   item for ProForm so you can get it to more easily.

You may now use the control panel page for ProForm to being managing forms.
