<h1><a name="form_settings_basic">Advanced Form Settings</a></h1>
<p>The following settings are available for forms when certain options have been enabled in your global ExpressionEngine <b>config.php</b> file. This file is normally located at:</p>
<p><dfn>system/expressionengine/config/config.php</dfn></p>
<p>Certain options are only available in one Form Type or the other, as noted in the <b>Form Types</b> column.</p>
<p class="critical"><strong>Warning</strong> These options are considered experimental and should be used with caution. Always make sure to keep frequent backups and verify the behavior of any advanced settings you are using (for instance, if you use the options to store form data in an encrypted format - ensure you are able to decrypt data and move it to other systems you need to move it to).</p>

            <td>When set, this option redirects all data that would normally be stored in a database table generated by ProForm to a custom table you have already defined in the database. This option disables all manipulation of the table as well.<br/><br/>
                Note that this option is still considered experimental. In order to use this option, you must enable it by editing your ExpressionEngine <b>config.php</b> file to include this line:<br/><br/>
                $config['proform_allow_table_override'] = 'y';</td>

                Encryption comes in two flavors - a simple and insecure XOR technique and a more secure method based on the Mcrypt extension, which must be installed. The default is the insecure XOR unless you have Mcrypt installed and have set a secure encryption key in your <dfn>config.php</dfn> file. Please refer to the CodeIgniter reference&#39;s warnings about their encryption class for more details and instructions for how to set your encryption key:<br />

                (The config file is usually located at <dfn>system/expressionengine/config/config.php</dfn> instead of the location noted on that page.)<br/><br/>
                Note that this option is still considered experimental. In order to use this option, you must enable it by editing your ExpressionEngine <b>config.php</b> file to include this line:<br/><br/>
