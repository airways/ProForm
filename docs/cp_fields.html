    <h1>Field Management (BETA)</h1>

    <p><a href="index.html">&larr; ProForm Docs Index</a></p>

    <p>The Fields page in <dfn>ProForm</dfn> provides a list of all of the fields that are available to be used in forms.</p>
    
    <p class="tip"><b>Beta</b> This module is currently in a public beta phase, but has been used on multiple sites in an internal beta for several months. Any issues should be filed with the developer at the Devot:ee site for <kbd>ProForm</kbd> and will be fixed promptly.</p>

    <h2><a name="create_field">Creating a New Field</a></h2>

    <p>To create a new field, use the <kbd>Create a Field</kbd> button on the Fields page.</p>
    
    <p>A field can also be created directly from the Form Layout view of a form through the Add button. If you would
    like to create a new field and immediately add it to a form, go to the form's Form Layout then select New Field from
    the Add a Field drop down and click Add. This will begin the New Field form, and return you to the form's layout
    after creating the new field.</p>
    
    <p>In either case, when creating a field you will be asked for the settings in the following section.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="field_settings">Field Settings</a></h2>
    
    <p>After creating a new field, the same settings that are set when it is initially created can be updated at any
    time by clicking either the Edit link for the field from a form's layout, or by clicking the field's name on the Fields
    page.</p>
    
    <p>The following settings are available for fields.</p>
    
    <h4>Field Settings</h4>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th width="170">Field</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Full Field Name (Label)</b></td>
            <td>Human friendly field name, used in UI and used to label the field in the default template.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Field Name</b></td>
            <td>Short field name which must be used as the actual name of the input or other HTML element in the form template.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Type</b></td>
            <td>The type of the field. Most fields can be set as String fields. See the Field Types section below for more information.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Length</b></td>
            <td>Length limit on the field. If the length is not specified, it will be set to 255 characters. Settings the limit
            to longer than this may cause a slight performance degradation as a different database column must be used for
            longer values.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Validation</b></td>
            <td>Allows configuration of a large number of validation rules and filters to be applied to the value. This ensures
            that data entered matches expected patterns. See the Validation section below for more information on the types of
            rules available.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p class="important"><strong>Warning</strong> If data has already been entered into any of the forms that use a field, changing
    the length of the field to be shorter than it was previously will likely cause data loss as any values that are too long
    will be truncated.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="types">Field Types</a></h2>
    
    <p><dfn>ProForm</dfn> supports multiple field types. Most fields can safely use the String type, however other field types
    can optimize the column chosen to store the data and work well with the default template code to suggest input types to
    correspond to the various field types. Additional types provide programatic functionality such as subscribing to mailing
    lists.</p>
    
    <p>Note that the Default HTML Control values provided here are based on the <a href="form_sample_template.html">Sample Template</a>,
    and can easily be changed by simply modifying the template you use to generate your forms. <dfn>ProForm</dfn> does not generate
    any markup itself - it leaves all of the display of your forms to your exact specifications.</p>

    <h2><a name="validation_filtering">Validation and Filtering</a></h2>
